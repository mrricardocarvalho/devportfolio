# Memory Bank Documentation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the strategy for documenting and utilizing the Memory Bank to guide the project development. It includes steps for structuring the documentation, integrating the Memory Bank into the workflow, and ensuring ongoing updates.

## Detailed Plan

### 1. Initial Documentation Setup
- **Goal:** Populate and structure the Memory Bank files to include detailed documentation based on the project goal.
- **Actions:**
  - Update `productContext.md` with the provided project details (already partially done).
  - Create a consistent documentation format across all Memory Bank files.
  - Use the timeline and risks sections to break down the project into manageable phases.

    B --> C[Add detailed sections to activeContext.md]
    C --> D[Create decisionLog.md entries for key choices]
    D --> E[Establish progress tracking in progress.md]
  ```

### 2. Project Structure and Content Organization
- **Goal:** Organize the Memory Bank to serve as a central hub for all project-related information.
- **Actions:**
  - Define roles for each file:
    - `productContext.md`: High-level overview, goals, features, and architecture.
    - `activeContext.md`: Track current focus, recent changes, and open issues.
    - `progress.md`: Maintain a task list with status updates.
    - `decisionLog.md`: Document significant decisions with rationale.
    - `systemPatterns.md`: Record coding and architectural patterns.
  - Ensure all entries include timestamps for traceability.
  - Standardize the format for footnotes to match the project timeline and changes.

      B --> C[progress.md]
      C --> D[decisionLog.md]
      D --> E[System Patterns]
    end
  ```

### 3. Integration into Development Workflow
- **Goal:** Make the Memory Bank an integral part of the project lifecycle to facilitate collaboration and decision-making.
- **Actions:**
  - Schedule regular updates (e.g., after each phase completion or major decision).
  - Use the Memory Bank for cross-mode communication (e.g., between Architect and Code modes).
  - Set up reminders to update files like `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` during development.
  - Integrate with tools like GitHub for version control to keep the Memory Bank in sync.
- **Mermaid Diagram:**
  ```mermaid

    MemoryBank->>Developer: Provide context for code changes
    Developer->>MemoryBank: Log decisions in decisionLog.md
  ```

### 4. Risk Mitigation and Quality Assurance
- **Goal:** Address potential risks and ensure the documentation is accurate and up-to-date.
- **Actions:**
  - Review the risks in `productContext.md` and update `decisionLog.md` with mitigation strategies.
  - Conduct a peer review of Memory Bank entries to maintain quality.
  - Use the Memory Bank to track assumptions and validate them during implementation.
- **Mermaid Diagram:**
  ```mermaid

    "Update Decision Log": 30
    "Peer Review": 25
  ```

This plan ensures that the Memory Bank is fully utilized for project documentation, providing a clear, traceable record of decisions, progress, and context. It aligns with the MEMORY_BANK_strategy for ongoing updates and helps maintain project coherence.
